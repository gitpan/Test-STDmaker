1.0 SCOPE
    This paragraph identifies and provides an overview of the released
    files.

  1.1 Indentification

    This release is a collection of Perl modules that extend the
    capabilities of the Perl language.

  1.2 System overview

    The system is the Perl programming language software. The system does
    not have any hardware. The Perl programming language contains two
    features that are utilized by this release:

    1   Program Modules to extend the languages

    2   Plain Old Documentation (POD) that may be embedded in the language

    These features are established by the referenced documents.

    The "fgenerate" method provides the following capabilities:

    1   Automate Perl related programming needed to create a test script
        resulting in reduction of time and cost.

    2   Translate a short hand Software Test Description (STD) file into a
        Perl test script that eventually makes use of the Test module.

    3   Translate the sort hand STD data file into a Perl test script that
        demonstrates the features of the the module under test.

    4   Provide in a the POD of a STD file information required by a
        Military/Federal Government Software Test Description (STD) document
        that may easily be index and accessed by automated Test software.

    5   Automate generation of test information required by (STD2167A) from
        the STD file making it economical to provide this information for
        even commercial projects. The ISO standards and certification are
        pushing commercial projects more and more toward using 2167
        nomenclature and providing STD2167A information.

  1.3 Document overview.

    This document releases Test::STDmaker version 0.01 providing description
    of the inventory, installation instructions and other information
    necessary to utilize and track this release.

  3.3 Changes

    Changes are as follows:

    *   Low level subroutines are broken out as separate distribution
        modules: Test::TestUtil Test::Tech DataPort::FileType::FormDB
        DataPort::DataFile

    *   The STD::STDgen was renamed Test::STDmaker to comply with CPAN
        directives to use existing top levels

    The file structure from release 0.02 was restructured as follows:

     rmtree 'lib\\Datacop';
      rmtree 'lib\\SVD';
     rmtree 'lib\\STD';
     rmtree 't\\DataCop';
     unlink 'lib\\Test\\STDtype\\Clean.pm';

  3.4 Adaptation data.

    This installation requires that the installation site has the Perl
    programming language installed. Installation sites running Microsoft
    Operating systems require the installation of Unix utilities. An
    excellent, highly recommended Unix utilities for Microsoft operating
    systems is unxutils by Karl M. Syring. A copy is available at the
    following web sites:

     http://unxutils.sourceforge.net
     http://packages.SoftwareDiamnds.com

    There are no other additional requirements or tailoring needed of
    configurations files, adaptation data or other software needed for this
    installation particular to any installation site.

  3.5 Related documents.

    There are no related documents needed for the installation and test of
    this release.

  3.6 Installation instructions.

    To installed the release file, use the CPAN module in the Perl release
    or the INSTALL.PL script at the following web site:

     http://packages.SoftwareDiamonds.com

    Follow the instructions for the the chosen installation software.

    The distribution file is at the following respositories:

       http://www.softwarediamonds/packages/Test-STDmaker-0.01
       http://www.perl.com/CPAN-local/authors/id/S/SO/SOFTDIA/Test-STDmaker-0.01

  3.6.1 Installation support.

    If there are installation problems or questions with the installation
    contact

     603 882-0846 E<lt>support@SoftwareDiamonds.comE<gt>

  3.6.2 Installation Tests.

    Most Perl installation software will run the following test script(s) as
    part of the installation:

     t/Test/STDmaker/STDmaker.t

  3.7 Possible problems and known errors

    The open issues are as follows:

    *   The STD2167 option is commented out.

    *   There is no requirement tracebility to a particular line in a file
        containing the expected results

    *   There is no provisions for Software Development Document (SDD)
        design requirements and tracing functional requirements to design
        requirements and to design requirements tests

    *   Functional requirements are basically requirements important to the
        end-user and stated for the point of view of the end-user. Test
        coverage is not an issue. However, when design requirements are
        added to the mix, test coverage of the design requirements becomes
        important.
