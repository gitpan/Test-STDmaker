DESCRIPTION
    The "Test::STDmaker" program module provides the following capabilities:

    1   Automate Perl related programming needed to create a test script
        resulting in reduction of time and cost.

    2   Translate a short hand Software Test Description (STD) file into a
        Perl test script that eventually makes use of the Test module.

    3   Translate the sort hand STD data file into a Perl demo script that
        demonstrates the features of the the module under test.

    4   Provide in the POD of a STD file information required by a
        Military/Federal Government Software Test Description (the STD
        manpage) document that may easily be index and accessed by automated
        Test software. ISO, British Military require most of the same
        information, US agencies such as the FAA. The difference is that
        ISO, British Military do not dictate detail format. US agencies such
        as FAA will generally tailor down the DOD required formats. Thus,
        there is an extremely wide variation in the format of the same
        information among ISO certified comericail activities and militaries
        other than US. Once the information is in a POD, different
        translators may format nearly exactly as dictated by the end user,
        whether it is the US DOD, ISO certified commericial activity,
        British Military or whoever. By being able to provide the most
        demanding, which is usually US DOD, capabilities is there for all
        the others.

    The "Test::STDmaker" package relieves the designer and developer from
    the burden of filling out word processor boiler plate templates (whether
    run-off, Word, or vi), counting oks, providing documentation examples,
    tracing tests to test requirments, making sure it is in the proper
    corporate, ISO or military format, and other such extremely time
    consuming, boring, development support tasks. Instead the designers and
    developers need only to fill in a form using a test description short
    hand. The "Test::STDmaker" will take it from there and automatically and
    quickly generate the desired test scripts, demo scripts, and test
    description documents. It does not make economically sense to have
    expensive talent or even suppport clerks to manually do this work when
    it can so easily be automated.

    The "Test::STDmaker" class package automates the generation of Software
    Test Descriptions (STD) Plain Old Documentation (POD), test scripts,
    demonstrations scripts and the execution of the generated test scripts
    and demonstration scripts. It will automatically insert the output from
    the demonstration script into the POD *-headx Demonstration* section of
    the file being tested.

    The inputs for "Test::STDmaker" class package is the "__DATA__" section
    of Software Test Description (STD) program module and a list of targets.
    The __DATA__ section must contain a STD forms text database in the
    Tie::Form format. Most of the targets are the ouputs. Each output has
    its own program module in the "Test::STDmaker::" repository. The targets
    are the name of a program module that process the form database as
    follows:

     target output program module   description
     -------------------------------------------------------
     Check  Test::STDmaker::Check   cleans database, counts oks
     Demo   Test::STDmaker::Demo    generates demo script
     STD    Test::STDmaker::STD     generates STD POD
     Verify Test::STDmaker::Verify  generates test script

    The interface between the "Test::STDmaker" package each of the driver
    packages in the "Test::STDmaker::" repository is the same. New driver
    packages may be added by putting them in the "Test::STDmaker::"
    repository without modifying the "Test::STDmaker" package. The
    "Test::STDmaker" package will find it and add it to is target list.

    The STD program modules that contain the forms database should reside in
    a "'t'" subtree whose root is the same as the "'lib'" subtree. For the
    host site development and debug, the "lib" directory is most convenient
    for test program modules. However, when building the distribution file
    for installation on a target site, test library program modules should
    be placed at the same level as the test script.

    For example, while debugging and development the directory structure may
    look as follows:

     development_dir   
       lib
         MyTopLevel
           MyUnitUnderTest.pm  # code program module
         Data::xxxx.pm  # test library program modules

         File::xxxx.pm  # test library program modules
       t
         MyTopLevel
           MyUnitUnderTest.pm  # STD program module

     # @INC contains the absolute path for development_dir

    while a target site distribution directory for the "MyUnitUnderTest"
    would be as follows:

     devlopment_dir 
       release_dir
         MyUnitUnderTest_dir
           lib
             MyTopLevel
               MyUnitUnderTest.pm  # code program module
           t
             MyTopLevel
               MyUnitUnderTest.pm  # STD program module

               Data::xxxx.pm  # test library program modules

               File::xxxx.pm  # test library program modules

     # @INC contains the absolute path for MyUnitUnderTest_dir 
     # and does not contain the absolute path for devlopment_dir

    When "Test::STDmaker" methods searches for a STD PM, it looks for it
    first under all the directories in @INC This means the STD program
    module name must start with ""t::"". Thus the program module name for
    the Unit Under Test (UUT), "MyTopLevel::MyUnitUNderTest", and the UUT
    STD program module, "t::MyTopLevel::MyUnitUNderTest", are always
    different.

    Use the "tmake.pl" (test make), found in the distribution file, cover
    script for Test::STDmaker to process a STD database module to generate a
    test script for debug and development as follows:

     tmake -verbose -nounlink -pm=t::MyTopLevel::MyUnitUnderTest

    The "tmake" script creates a "$std" object and runs the "tmake" method

     my $std = new Test::STDmaker(\%options);
     $std->tmake(@ARGV);

    which replaces the POD in "t::MyTopLevel::MyUnitUNderTest" STD program
    module and creates the following files

     development_dir
       t
         MyTopLevel
           MyUnitUNderTest.t  # test script
           MyUnitUNderTest.d  # demo script
           temp.pl            # calculates test steps and so forth

    The names for these three files are determined by fields in the
    "__DATA__" section of the "t::MyTopLevel::MyUnitUNderTest" STD program
    module. All geneated scripts will contain Perl code to change the
    working directory to the same directory as the test script and add this
    directory to "@INC" so the Perl can find any test library program
    modules placed in the same directory as the test script.

    The first step is to debug temp.pl in the "development_dir"

     perl -d temp.pl

    Make any correction to the STD program module
    "t::MyTopLevel::MyUnitUNderTest" not to "temp.pl" and repeat the above
    steps. After debugging "temp.pl", use the same procedure to debug
    "MyUnitUnderTest.t", "MyUnitUnderTest.d"

      perl -d MyUnitUnderTest.t
      perl -d MyUnitUnderTest.d

    Again make any correction to the STD program module
    "t::MyTopLevel::MyUnitUNderTest" not to "MyUnitUnderTest.t"
    "MyUnitUnderTest.d"

    Once this is accomplished, develop and debug the UUT using the test
    script as follows:

     perl -d MyUnitUnderTest.t

    Finally, when the "MyTopLevel::MyUnitUNderTest" is working replace the
    "=head1 DEMONSTRATION" in the "MyTopLevel::MyUnitUNderTest" with the
    output from "MyUnitUnderTest.d" and run the "MyUnitUnderTest.t" under
    "Test::Harness" with the following:

     tmake -verbose -test_verbose -demo -report -run -pm=t::MyTopLevel::MyUnitUnderTest

    Since there is no "-unlink" option, "tmake" removes the "temp.pl" file.

    Keep the "t" subtree under the "development library" for regression
    testing of the development library.

    Use ExtUtils::SVDmaker to automatically build a release directory from
    the development directory, run the test script using only the files in
    the release directory, bump revisions for files that changed since the
    last distribution, and package the UUT program module, test script and
    test library program modules and other files for distrubtion.

STD Program Module
    The input(s) for the "Test::STDmaker" package are Softare Test
    Description Program Modules (STM PM).

    A STD PM consists of three sections as follows:

    Perl Code Section
        The code section contains the following Perl scalars: $VERSION,
        $DATE, and $FILE. STDmaker automatically generates this section.

    STD POD Section
        The STD POD section is either a tailored Detail STD format or a
        tailored STD2167 format described below. STDmaker automatically
        generates this section.

    STD Form Database Section
        This section contains a STD Form Database that STDmaker uses (only
        when directed by specifying STD as the output option) to generate
        the Perl code section and the STD POD section.

  POD Section

    The POD sectin contains the detail STD for the program module under
    test. US DOD 490A 3.1.2 allows for general/detail separation of
    requirement for a group of configuration items with a set of common
    requirements. Perl program modules qualify as such. This avoids
    repetition of common requirements in detail specifications. The detail
    specification and the referenced general specification then constitute
    the total requirements.

  Form Database Section

    The "Test::STDmaker" module uses the Tie::Form lenient format to access
    the data in the Data Section.

    The requirements of Tie::Form lenient format govern in case of a
    conflict with the description herein.

    In accordance with Tie::Form, STD PM data consists of series of *field
    name* and *field data* pairs.

    The Tie::Form format separator strings are as follows:

     End of Field Name:  [^:]:[^:]
     ENd of Field Data:  [^\^]\^[^\^]
     End of Record    :  ~-~

    In other words, the separator strings have a string format of the
    following:

     (not_the_char) . (char) . (not_the_char)

    The following are valid *FormDB* fields:

     name: data^

     name:
     data
      ..
     data
     ^

    Separator strings are escaped by added an extra chacater. For example,

    DIR:::Module: $data ^
          unescaped field name:  DIR::MOdule

    DIR::Module:: : $data ^
          unescaped field name: DIR:Module:

        Since the field name ends in a colon the format requires a space
        between the field name and the *end of field name colon*. Since the
        *FormDB* format ignores leading and trailing white space for field
        names, this space is not part of the field name. space.

    This is customary form that all of us have been forced to fill out
    through out our lives with the addition of ending field punctuation.
    Since the separator sequences are never part of the field name and data,
    the code to read it is trivial. For being computer friendly it is hard
    to beat. And, altough most of us are adverse to forms, it makes good try
    of being people friendly.

    An example of a STD Form follows:

     File_Spec: Unix^
     UUT: Test::STDmaker::tg1^

    This is a very compact database form. The actual test code is Perl
    snippets that will be passed to the appropriate build-in, behind the
    scenes Perl subroutines.

STD PM Form Database Fields
    The following database file fields are information needed to generate
    the documentation files and not information about the tests themselves:

  Author field

    The *prepare for* STD title page entry.

  Classification field

    Security classification.

  Copyright field

    Any copyright and license requirements. This is integrated into the Demo
    Script, Test Script and the STD module.

  Detail_Template field

    This field contains a template program module that the "Test::STDmaker"
    package method uses to generate the STD POD section of the STD PM.
    Normally this field is left blank and the "Test::STDmaker" package
    methods uses its built-in detail template.

    The "Test::STDmaker" package methods merges the following variables with
    the template in generating the "STD" file:

    Date UUT_PM Revision End_User Author Classification Test_Script SVD
    Tests STD_PM Test_Descriptions See_Also Trace_Requirement_Table
    Trace_Test_Table Copyright

  Demo field

    The file for the "Demo output" relative to the STD PM directory.

  End_User field

    The *prepare for* STD title page entry.

  File_Spec field

    the operating system file specification used for the following fields:

     Verify Demo

    Valid values are Unix MacOS MSWin32 os2 VMS epoc. The scope of this
    value is very limited. It does not apply to any file specification used
    in the test steps nor the files used for input to the "Test::STDmaker"
    package method.

  Revision field

    Enter the revision for the STD POD. Revision numbers, in accordance with
    standard engineering drawing practices are letters A .. B AA .. ZZ
    except for the orginal revision which is -.

  STD2167_Template field

    Similar to the Detail_Template field except that the template is a
    tailored STD2167 template.

  See_Also field

    This section provides links to other resources.

  Test Description Fields

    The Test Description Fields are described in the next section.

  UUT field

    The Unit Under Test (UUT).

  Verify field

    The file for the "Verify output" relative to the STD PM directory.

STD PM Form Database Test Description Fields
    The test description fields are order sensitive data as follows:

  A

     A: actual-expression 

    This is the actual Perl expression under test and used for the STD
    4.x.y.3 Test inputs.

  E

     E: expected-expression 

    This is the expected results. This should be raw Perl values and used
    for the <STD 4.x.y.4 Expected test results.|Docs::US_DOD::STD/4.x.y.4
    Expected test results.>

    This field triggers processing of the previous fields as a test. It must
    always be the last field of a test. On failure, testing continues.

  C

      C: code

    The "code" field data is free form Perl code. This field is generally
    used for STD 4.x.y.2 Prerequisite conditions.

  DO

     DO: comment

    This field tags all the fields up to the next "A: actual-expression" for
    use only in generating a Demo output

  DM

     DM: msg

    This field assigns a diagnostic message to the test step. The test
    software prints out this message on test failure.

  N

     N: name_data

    This field provides a name for the test. This is usually the same name
    as the base name for the STD file.

  ok

     ok: test_number

    The "ok: test_number" is a the test number that results from the
    execution of "&TEST::ok" by the previous "E: data" or "SE: data"
    expression. A STD file does not require any "ok:" fields since The
    "Test::STDmaker" package methods will automatically generate the "ok:
    test_number" fields.

  QC

     QC: code

    This field is the same as a "C: code" field except that for the demo
    script. The demo script will exectue the code, but will not print it
    out.

  R

     R: requirement_data

    The *requirement_data* cites a binding requirement that is verified by
    the test. The test software uses the *requirement_data* to automatically
    generate tracebility information that conforms to STD 4.x.y.1
    Requirements addressed.

    Many times the relationship between binding requirements and the a test
    is vague and can even stretch the imagination. Perhaps by tracing the
    binding requirement down to an actual test number, will help force
    requirements that have clean cut tests in qualitative terms that can
    verify and/or validate a requirement.

  S

     S: expression

    The mode "S: expression" provides means to conditionally preform a test.
    The condition is usually platform dependent. In other words, a feature
    may be provided, say for a VMS platform that is not available on a
    Microsoft platform.

  SF

     SF: value,msg

    This field assigns a value to the skip flag and optional message to the
    skip flag. A zero turns it off; otherwise, it is turned on. The test
    software prints out the msg for each file skipped.

  SE

     SE: expected-expression

    This field is the same as E: expected-expression except that testing
    stops on failure. The test software implements the stop by turning on
    the skip flag. When the skip flag is on, every test will be skip.

  T

     T: number_of_tests - todo tests

    This field provides the number of tests and the number of the todo
    tests. The "Test::STDmaker" package methods will automatically fill in
    this field.

  TS

     TS: \&subroutine

    This field provides a subroutine used to determine if an actual result
    is within expected parameters with the following synopsis:

     $success = &subroutine($acutal_result,$expected_paramters)

  U

     U: comment

    This tags a test as testing a feature or capability under development.
    The test is added to the *todo* list.

  VO

     VO: comment

    This field tags all the fields up to the next "E: expected-expression"
    for use only in generating a Verify output

METHODS
    The "STDmaker" class inherits the all the methods from the File::Maker
    class. The additional "STDmaker" methods are follows.

  check_std

     $success = $std->load_std($std_pm);

    The "load_std" loads a STD database in the Tie::Form format from the
    "__DATA__" section of "$std_pm". The subroutine adds the following to
    the object hash, "$std":

     hash
     key     description 
     ----------------------------------------------------------
     std_db  ordered name,data pairs from the $std_pm database
     Record  complete $std_pm database record
     std_pm  $std_pm;
     Date    date using $std->get_date()
     file    base file of $std_pm
     vol     volume of $std_pm
     dir     directory of $std_pm

    It changes the class of object "$std" to "Test::STDmaker::Check",
    keeping the same data hash as the incoming object. Since the class is
    now "Test::STD:Check" and this class inherits methods from
    "Test::STDmaker" and the methods of both classes are now visible.

    The "$std" then executes the incoming object data using first the
    "generate" method and then the "print" method herein which in turn use
    the methods from the "Test::STDmaker::Check" class.

  find_t_roots

     @t_path = find_t_paths()

    The "find_t_roots" subroutine operates on the assumption that the test
    files are a subtree to a directory named *t* and the *t* directories are
    on the same level as the last directory of each directory tree specified
    in *@INC*. If this assumption is not true, this method most likely will
    not behave very well.

  get_date

     $date = $std->get_date();

    The "get_date" subroutine returns the "$date" in the yyyy/mm/dd format.

  tmake

     $std->tmake( @targets, \%options ); 
     $std->tmake( @targets ); 
     $std->tmake( \%options  );

    The "tmake" method reads the data from the form database (FormDB)
    section of a Software Test Description program module (STD PM), clean
    it, and use the cleaned data to generate the output file(s) based on the
    targets as follows:

     target    description 
     ----------------------------------------
     all       generates all outputs
     Demo      generates demo script
     Verify    generates a test script
     STD       generates and replaces the STD PM POD
     Check     checks test description database

    No target is the same as the "all" target.

    The "@options" are as follows:

    demo option
         demo => 1

        run the all demo scripts and use thier output to replace the Unit
        Under Test (UUT) =headx Demonstration POD section. The STD PM UUT
        field specifies the UUT file.

    nounlink
         nounlink => 1

        do not delete the check test script

    pm
         pm => $program_module

        The STD PM is a Perl program module specified using the Perl '::'
        notation. The module must be in one of the directories in the @INC
        array. For example, the STD PM for this program module is

         pm => t::Test::STDmaker::STDmaker

        If there is no pm option, the "tmake" subroutine uses "t::STD"

    report option
         report => 1

        run the all test scripts and use thier output to replace the Unit
        Under Test (UUT) =headx Test Report POD section. The STD PM UUT
        field specifies the UUT file.

    run option
         run => 1

        run all generated test scripts using the Test::Harness

    test_verbose option
         test_verbose => 1           

        use verbose mode when using the Test::Harness

    verbose option
         verbose => 1           

        print out informative messages about processing steps and such

INTERNAL METHODS
    The methods in this section are methods internal to the
    "Test::STDmaker". The are more of design in nature and not part of the
    functional interface for the package. Typically they will never be used
    outside of the "Test::STDmaker". They do provide some insight on the
    form data processing and the exchange between the c<Test::STDmaker>
    package and the driver packages in the "Test::STDmaker::" repository.

  build

     $success = $std->build($std_driver_class);

    The "$output_type" is the name of a driver in the "Test::STDmaker"
    repository. The "build" subroutine takes "$output_type" and recast the
    "$std" class to "Test::STDmaker::$std_driver_class" driver class The
    "bless" subroutine does do class recasting as follows:

     $std_driver = bless $std, Test::STDmaker::$output_type

    Typically the recasted class is one of the following:

    Test::STDmaker::Check
    Test::STDmaker::Demo
    Test::STDmaker::STD
    Test::STDmaker::Verify
    New drivers class may be added by including them in the
    "Test::STDmaker::" repository and thus expand the above list. The
    "Test::STDmaker" methods will automatically find the new driver classes.

    The "build" subroutine then uses the recast object to call the
    "generate" method followed by the "print" methods described below. Since
    the object is now of the "Test::STDmaker::$std_driver_class" class which
    inherits the "Test::STDmaker" class, it used the
    "&Test::STDmaker::generate" and "&Test::STDmaker::print" methods to
    communicate with the methods in the "Test::STDmaker::$output_type"
    class.

  generate

     $sucess = $std_driver->generate();

    The c<generate> subroutine is the work horse. It takes each ordered
    "$name,$data" pair from the "@{$std-"{std_pm}}> array and executes the
    method "$name" with "$name,$data" as arguments. The "$name" variable is
    the test description short hands "A" "E" and so on, STD PM Form Database
    Test Description Fields.

  perl_command

     $myperl = perl_command();

    When running under some CPAN testers setup, the test harness perl
    executable may not be the same as the one for the backtick `perl
    $command` and crash and burn with errors such as

    Perl lib version (v5.8.4) doesn't match executable version (v5.6.1) at
    /usr/local/perl-5.8.4/lib/5.8.4/sparc-linux/Config.pm line 32.

    The "perl_command" uses "$^X" to return the current executable Perl that
    may be used in backticks without crashing and burning.

  print

     $success = $std_driver->print($file_out);

    The "print" method prints any data accumulated in "$std" hash to
    "$file_out". The method initiates the "post_print" method, provided it
    exists as a "Test::STDmaker::$output_type" method.

REQUIREMENTS
    This section establishes the functional requirements for the
    "Test::STDmaker" module and the "Test::STDmaker" package package
    methods. All other subroutines in the Test::STDmaker module and modules
    used by the "Test::STDmaker" module support the "Test::STDmaker" package
    methods. Their requirements are of a design nature and not included. All
    design requirements may change at any time without notice to improve
    performance as long as the change does not impact the functional
    requirements and the test results of the functional requirements.

    Binding functional requirements, in accordance with DOD STD 490A, are
    uniquely identified with the pharse 'shall[dd]' where dd is an unique
    number for each section. The phrases such as *will, should, and may* do
    not identified binding requirements. They provide clarifications of the
    requirements and hints for the module design.

    The general "Test::STDmaker" Perl module requirements are as follows:

    load [1]
        shall[1] load without error and

    pod check [2]
        shall[2] passed the Pod::Checker check without error.

  Clean "Form Database Section" requirements

    Before generating any output from a "Form Database Section" read from a
    STD PM, the "Test::STDmaker" package methods fill clean the data. The
    requirements for cleaning the data are as follows:

    clean "Form Database Section" [1]
        The "Test::STDmaker" package methods shall[1] ensure there is a test
        step number field "ok: $test_number^" after each " E: $expected ^"
        and each "E: $expected^" field. The "$test_number" will apply to all
        fields preceding the "ok: $test_number^" to the previous "ok:
        $test_number^" or <T: $total_tests^> field

    clean "Form Database Section" [2]
        The "Test::STDmaker" package methods shall[2] ensure all test
        numbers in the "ok: test_number^" fields are numbered the same as
        when executed by the test script.

    clean "Form Database Section" [3]
        The "Test::STDmaker" package methods shall[3] ensure the first test
        field is "T: $total_tests^" where "$total_tests" is the number of
        "ok: $test_number^" fields.

    clean "Form Database Section" [4]
        The "Test::STDmaker" package methods shall[4] include a "$todo_list"
        in the "T: $total_tests - $todo_list^" field where each number in
        the list is the $test_number for a "U: ^" field.

    The "Test::STDmaker" package methods will perform this processing as
    soon as it reads in the STD PM. All file generation will use the
    processed, cleaned internal test data instead of the raw data directly
    from the STD PM.

  Verify output file

    When the "tmake" subroutine c<@targets> contains "verify", "all" (case
    insensitive) or is empty, the "Test::STDmaker" package methods, for each
    input STD PM, will produce an verify ouput file. The functional
    requirements specify the results of executing the verify output file.
    The contents of the verify output file are of a design nature and
    function requirements are not applicable.

    The requirements for the generated verify output file are as follow:

    verify file [1]
        The "Test::STDmaker" package methods shall[1] obtained the name for
        the verify output file from the "Verify" field in the STD PM and
        assume it is a UNIX file specification relative to STD PM.

    verify file [2]
        The "Test::STDmaker" package methods shall[2] generate a test script
        that when executed will, for each test, execute the "C: $code"
        fields and compared the results obtained from the "A: $actual^"
        actual expression with the results from the "E: $epected^" expected
        expression and produce an output compatible with the
        <"Test::Harness" module. A test is the fields between the "ok:
        $test_number" fields of a cleaned STD PM. The generated test script
        will provide skip test functionality by processing the "S:
        $skip-condition", "DO: comment" and "U: comment" test fields and
        producing suitable Test::Harness output.

    verify file [3]
        The "Test::STDmaker" package methods shall[3] output the "N: $name^"
        field data as a <"Test::Harness" compatible comment.

    The "Test::STDmaker" package methods will properly compare complex data
    structures produce by the "A: $actual^" and "E: $epected^" expressions
    by utilizing modules such as Data::Secs2 subroutines.

  Demo output file

    When the "tmake" subroutine c<@targets> contains "demo", "all" (case
    insensitive) or is empty, the "Test::STDmaker" package methods, for each
    input STD PM, will produce a demo ouput file. The functional
    requirements specify the results of executing the demo output file. The
    contents of the demo output file are of a design nature and function
    requirements are not applicable.

    The requirements for the generated demo output file are as follow:

    demo file [1]
        The "Test::STDmaker" package methods shall[1] obtained the name for
        the demo output file from the "Demo" field in the STD PM and assume
        it is a UNIX file specification relative to STD PM.

    demo file [2]
        The "Test::STDmaker" package methods shall[2] generate the a demo
        script that when executed will produce an output that appears as if
        the actual "C: ^" and "A: ^" where typed at a console followed by
        the results of the execution of the "A: ^" field. The purpose of the
        demo script is to provide automated, complete examples, of the using
        the Unit Under Test. The generated demo script will provide skip
        test functionality by processing the "S: $skip-condition", "VO:
        comment" and "U: comment" test fields.

  STD PM POD

    When the "tmake" subroutine c<@targets> contains "STD", "all" (case
    insensitive) or is empty, the "Test::STDmaker" package methods, for each
    input STD PM, will generate the code and POD sections of the STD PM from
    the "Form Database Section" section. The requirements for the generated
    STD output file are as follow:

    STD PM POD [1]
        The "Test::STDmaker" package methods shall[2] produce the STD output
        file by taking the merging STD template file from either the
        "Detail_Template" field "STD2167_Template" field in the STD PM or a
        built-in template with the

        "Copyright Revision End_User Author SVD Classification"

        fields from the "Form Database Section " and the generated

        "Date UUT_PM STD_PM Test_Descriptions Test_Script Tests
        Trace_Requirement_Table Trace_Requirement_Table"

        fields.

    The "Test::STDmaker" package methods will generate fields for merging
    with the template file as follows:

    Date
        The current data

    UUT_PM
        The Perl :: module specfication for the UUT field in the "Form
        Database Section " database

    STD_PM
        The Perl :: module specification for the "Form Database Section "
        Unix file specification

    Test_Script
        The the "Verify" field in the "Form Database Section " database

    Tests
        The number of tests in the "Form Database Section " database

    Test_Descriptions
        A description of a test defined by the fields between "ok:" fields
        in the "Form Database Section " database. The test descriptions will
        be in a STD format as tailored by STDtailor

    Trace_Requirement_Table
        A table that relates the "R:" requirement fields to the test number
        in the "Form Database Section " database.

    Trace_Test_Table
        A table that relates the test number in the "Form Database Section "
        database to the "R:" requirement fields.

    The usual template file is the "STD/STD001.fmt" file. This template is
    in the STD format as tailored by STDtailor.

  Options requirements

    The "tmake" option processing requirements are as follows:

    file_out option [1]
        When the c<@targets> has only target, specifying the option

         { file_out => $file_out }

        shall[1] cause the "tmake" method to print the ouput to the file
        "$file_out" instead of the file specified in the STD PM. The
        $file_out specification will be in the UNIX specification relative
        to the STD PM.

    replace option [2]
        Specifying the option

         { replace => 1 } or { demo => 1 }

        with c<@targets> containing "Demo", shall[2] cause the c<tmake>
        method to execute the demo script that it generates and replace the
        "/(\n=head\d\s+Demonstration).*?\n=/i" section in the module named
        by the "UUT" field in "Form Database Section" with the output from
        the demo script.

    run option [3]
        Specifying the option

         { run => 1 }

        with the c<@targets> list containing "Verify", shall[3] cause the
        c<tmake> method to run the "Test::Harness" with the test script in
        non-verbose mode.

    verbose option [4]
        Specifying the options

         { run => 1, test_verbose => 1 }

        with the c<@targets> containg "Verify", shall[4] cause the "tmake"
        method to run the "Test::Harness" with the test script in verbose
        mode.

    fspec_out option [5]
        Specifying the option

         { fspec_out => I<$file_spec> }

        shall[5] cause the "Test::STDmaker" methods to translate the file
        names in the "STD" file output to the file specification
        *$file_spec*.

    fspec_in option [6]
        Specifying the option

         { fspec_in => I<$file_spec> }

        shall[6] cause the "Test::STDmaker" methods to use file
        specification *$file_spec* for the files in the STD PM database.

QUALITY ASSURANCE
    The module "t::Test::STDmaker::STDmaker" is the Software Test
    Description file (STD) for the "Test::STDmaker". module. This module
    contains all the information necessary for this module to verify that
    this module meets its requirements. In other words, this module will
    verify itself. This is valid because if something is wrong with this
    module, it will not be able to verify itself. And if it cannot verify
    itself, it cannot verify that another module meets its requirements.

    To generate all the test output files, run the generated test script,
    run the demonstration script, execute the following in any directory:

     tmake -verbose -demo -report -run -pm=t::Test::STDmaker::STDmaker

    Note that tmake.pl must be in the execution path "$ENV{PATH}" and the
    "t" directory on the same level as the "lib" that contains the
    "Test::STDmaker" module. The distribution file contains a copy of the
    tmake.pl test make script.

    And yes, the <Test::STDmaker> program module generates the test script
    to test the <Test::STDmaker> program module which is perfectly legal. If
    <Test::STDmaker> is not working, <Test::STDmaker> will fail to generate
    a valid test script.

1.0 SCOPE
    This paragraph identifies and provides an overview of the released
    files.

  1.1 Identification

    This release, identified in 3.2, is a collection of Perl modules that
    extend the capabilities of the Perl language.

  1.2 System overview

    The system is the Perl programming language software. As established by
    the Perl referenced documents, the "Test::STDmaker" program module
    extends the Perl language.

    The input to "Test::STDmaker" is the __DATA__ section of Software Test
    Description (STD) program module. The __DATA__ section must contain STD
    forms text database in the DataPort::FileType::DataDB format.

    Using the data in the database, the "Test::STDmaker" module provides the
    following:

    1   Automate Perl related programming needed to create a test script
        resulting in reduction of time and cost.

    2   Translate a short hand Software Test Description (STD) file into a
        Perl test script that eventually makes use of the "Test" module via
        added capabilities of the "Test::Tech module.

    3   Translate the sort hand STD data file into a Perl demo script that
        demonstrates the features of the the module under test.

    4   Replace the POD of a the STD file with the __DATA__ formDB text
        database, information required by a US Department of Defense (DOD)
        Software Test Description (STD) Data Item Description (DID).

    The "Test::STDmaker" package relieves the designer and developer from
    the burden of filling out templates, counting oks, providing
    documentation examples, tracing tests to test requirments, and other
    such time consuming, boring, development tasks. Instead the designers
    and developrs need only to fill in an a form. The "Test::STDmaker" will
    take it from there and automatically and quickly generate the desired
    test scripts, demo scripts, and test description documents.

    See the Test::STDmaker POD for further detail on the text database
    fields and the processing.

  1.3 Document overview.

    This document releases Test::STDmaker version 0.13 providing description
    of the inventory, installation instructions and other information
    necessary to utilize and track this release.

  3.3 Changes

    Changes are as follows:

    STD-STDgen-0.01
        This is the original release. There are no previous releases to
        change.

    STD-STDgen-0.02
        t/STD/tgA0.std changes
            Added test for DO: field

            Added test for VO: field

            Added a loop around two A: and E: fields.

        STD/TestGen.pm changes
            Added requirements for DO: VO: and looping a test

        STD/Check.pm changes
            Added and revise code to make DO: VO: and looping work

        STD/Verify.pm changes
            Added and revise code to make DO: VO: and looping work

    Test-STDmaker-0.01
        *   Low level subroutines are broken out as separate distribution
            modules: Test::TestUtil Test::Tech DataPort::FileType::FormDB
            DataPort::DataFile

        *   The STD::STDgen was renamed Test::STDmaker to comply with CPAN
            directives to use existing top levels whenever possible.

    Test-STDmaker-0.02
        Replaced using Test::TestUtil with File::FileUtil, Test::STD::Scrub,
        Test::STD::STDutil

        Added tests to deal with the fact that Data::Dumper produces
        different results on different Perls

        Added "Test" and "Data::Dumper" modules to the t directory so there
        are no surprises because of Test versions.

        Changed the generated test script to use subroutine interface of
        "Test::Tech" The object interface was removed.

    Test-STDmaker-0.03
        Make the same additions to @INC for "Test::STDtype::Demo" and
        "Test::STD::Check" as for "Test::STDtype::Verify".

        Changed from using "File::FileUtil" (disappeared) to the File::*
        modules broken out from "File::FileUtil"

    Test-STDmaker-0.04
        Changed from using "Test::STD::STDutil" (disappeared) to the File::*
        modules broken out from "Test::STD::STDutil"

        Added the -options_pm option and the ability to make multiple tests
        from a file list.

    Test-STDmaker-0.05
        Chnage name of Test::Table to Test::Column. Test::Table taken.

    Test-STDmaker-0.06
        Added DM Diagnostic Message tag

        Change the test so that test support program modules resides in
        distribution directory tlib directory instead of the lib directory.
        Because they are no longer in the lib directory, test support files
        will not be installed as a pre-condition for the test of this
        module. The test of this module will precede immediately. The test
        support files in the tlib directory will vanish after the
        installtion.

    Test-STDmaker-0.07
        Change the location where of Test::STDmaker expects the test library
        from tlib to the the same directory as the test script. Eliminated
        the need for File::TestPath. which adds the tlib directory to the
        @INC directory of lists with the below Perl build-ins:

         use FindBIN 
         use lib $FindBin::Bin;

        Replace the obsoleted File::PM2File program module with File::Where.

        Eliminated detecting broken Perl where Data::Dumper treats arrays of
        number as strings on some Perl and numbers on others. If something
        is broken, replace it with a fixed version in order to pass the
        tests for the Test::STDmaker program module.

    Test-STDmaker-0.08
         Subject: FAIL Test-Tech-0.18 i586-linux 2.4.22-4tr 
         From: cpansmoke@alternation.net 
         Date: Thu,  8 Apr 2004 15:09:35 -0300 (ADT) 

         PERL_DL_NONLAZY=1 /usr/bin/perl5.8.0 "-MExtUtils::Command::MM" "-e" "test_harness(0, 'blib/lib', 'blib/arch')" t/Test/Tech/Tech.t
         t/Test/Tech/Tech....Can't locate FindBIN.pm

         Summary of my perl5 (revision 5.0 version 8 subversion 0) configuration:
           Platform:
             osname=linux, osvers=2.4.22-4tr, archname=i586-linux

        This is a capitalization problem. The program module name is
        'FindBin' not 'FindBIN' which is part of Perl. Microsoft does not
        care about capitalization differences while linux does. This error
        is in the test script automatically generated by "Test::STDmaker"
        and was just introduced when moved test script libraries from "tlib"
        to the directory of the test script. Repaired "Test::STDmaker" and
        regenerated the distribution.

    Test-STDmaker-0.09
        Added the generated xxxx.d demo script prints out the test name as a
        comment.

        Added the "report" option that automatically runs all tests scripts
        and replaces the UUT program module "=headx Test Report" section
        with the output.

        The test software uses the lastest version of "Test::Tech". This
        impacted the expected values of the old tests slightly. Made the
        adjustments.

    Test-STDmaker-0.10
        Added the "&Test::Tech::is_skip" subroutine.

        Added a left edge space column to the =\headx test report
        automatically generated section so that POD formats it as code.

        Changed the look of the "demo" subroutine output to better resemble
        Perl code. Print the code straight forward without leading '=>'. Put
        a Perl comment '# ' in front of each result line instead of printing
        it straing forward.

        Added the "QC:" that is same for the "C:" field except for the demo
        script. The demo script silently executes a "QC:", quiet code, data.

        Recoded so that none of the modules uses "File::Data" program
        module.

    Test-STDmaker-0.11
        CPAN is picking up the templates as PODs. Escape out the template
        POD commands with a '\'.

        Under certain test conditions, the Software Test Description (STD)
        program module (PM) cannot be found.

        From: "Thurn, Martin" <martin.thurn@ngc.com> Subject: FAIL
        Test-STDmaker-0.10 sun4-solaris 2.8

        Can't locate t/Test/STDmaker/tgA1.pm in @INC (@INC contains: .
        /disk1/src/PERL/.cpanplus/5.9.1/5.9.1/build/Test-STDmaker-0.10/t/Tes
        t

        Added code that will add the appropriate directory to @INC for these
        test conditions.

        For regression tests, the POD describes the relationship between the
        'lib' and the 't' directories so that the "Test::STDmaker" package
        can find the STD PM.

    Test-STDmaker-0.12
        Problems with CPAN picking up wrong NAME for
        "Test::STDmaker::Verify" and "Test::STD::PerlSTD". Fixed

        Use lastest "Data::Secs2" that does not use "Data::SecsPack" unless
        needed. Some of the sites having trouble loading "Data::SecsPack"
        GMP libraray.

        Changed "Test::STDmaker::Demo" and "Test::STDmaker::Check" so they
        load "Test::Tech" after setting up "@INC". Else missing finding some
        test library modules because they are not in the "INC" path.

        Test Failure:

         Subject: FAIL Test-STDmaker-0.12 ppc-linux 2.4.19-4a 
         From: alian@cpan.org (CPAN Tester + CPAN++ automate) 

        Perl lib version (v5.8.4) doesn't match executable version (v5.6.0)
        at /usr/local/perl-5.8.4/lib/5.8.4/ppc-linux/Config.pm line 32.
        Compilation failed in require at
        /usr/local/perl-5.8.4/lib/5.8.4/FindBin.pm line 97. BEGIN
        failed--compilation aborted at
        /usr/local/perl-5.8.4/lib/5.8.4/FindBin.pm line 97. Compilation
        failed in require at temp.pl line 8.

        Analysis:

        Line 8 is a backtick `perl $command`. To get to line 8 everything
        must going well. Thus, suspect that the test harness perl executable
        is different than the command line perl executable.

        Corrective Action

        Introduced the "perl_command" subroutine that uses "$^X" to return
        the current executable Perl. Use the results of this subroutine
        instead of 'perl' in backticks. See how it goes.

  3.4 Adaptation data.

    This installation requires that the installation site has the Perl
    programming language installed. There are no other additional
    requirements or tailoring needed of configurations files, adaptation
    data or other software needed for this installation particular to any
    installation site.

    support are as follows:

    Installation Instructions.
        To installed the release package, use the CPAN module pr PPM module
        in the Perl release or the INSTALL.PL script at the following web
        site:

         http://packages.SoftwareDiamonds.com

        Follow the instructions for the the chosen installation software.

        If all else fails, the file may be manually installed. Enter one of
        the following repositories in a web browser:

          http://www.softwarediamonds/packages/
          http://www.perl.com/CPAN/authors/id/S/SO/SOFTDIA/

        Right click on 'Test-STDmaker-0.13.tar.gz' and download to a
        temporary installation directory. Enter the following where $make is
        'nmake' for microsoft windows; otherwise 'make'.

         gunzip Test-STDmaker-0.13.tar.gz
         tar -xf Test-STDmaker-0.13.tar
         perl Makefile.PL
         $make test
         $make install

        On Microsoft operating system, nmake, tar, and gunzip must be in the
        exeuction path. If tar and gunzip are not install, download and
        install unxutils from

         http://packages.softwarediamonds.com

        VERY IMPORTANT:

        The distribution package contains the cover "bin/tmake.pl" perl
        command script. Manually copy this into the execution path in order
        to use "STDmaker" from the command line. Rename it if there is a
        name conflict or just do not like the name.
